# CS123A-Term-Project-
Hello and welcome to our CS123A Term Project, where we tackle <a href="(https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-777)">OSD - 777</a>. This dataset dives into identifying the effects of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on mice. In our code, we build models using different algorithms to identify which one is best suited for predicting whether or not someone would experience cognitive decline as a result of GCR!

# üåü Highlights
- Utilized different ML algorithms to take our model to predict the effects of GCR on cognitive functionality through microglia
- Split data into Male and Female since GCR doesn't affect female mice as much as male mice

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview
Astronauts traveling to deep space will be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), which has the potential to negatively impact their cognitive functions. Understanding these effects is crucial for ensuring astronaut safety on their missions. To investigate this, our project will analyze the biological responses of mice exposed to a simulated form of space radiation. By analyzing their biological data, we aim to determine whether radiation exposure can lead to cognitive impairments.

The goal of our project is to apply and compare different machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and single-layer perceptrons, to predict how GCR affects the cognitive capabilities in mice. Using biological information collected from these mice, we will train models to classify whether an individual mouse is likely to experience cognitive deficits due to radiation exposure. Through this approach, we aim to assess the effectiveness and accuracy of these models in identifying potential risks, which could ultimately contribute to better predictive tools for studying space radiation effects in humans.

# ‚úçÔ∏è Authors
Hello! We're Trung Van and Charvi Choudhary, and we're the authors of this GitHub Repository! We created this mini project for our CS123A - Bioinformatics class, where we learned about the intersection between biology and AI/ML. We used what we learned to apply to a different dataset about GCR and its effects on cognitive functions.

# ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation
Make sure all the required libraries and methods are installed properly before running the notebook. Also, make sure that the OSD-777 is referenced properly in the code so you can pull the right information.
