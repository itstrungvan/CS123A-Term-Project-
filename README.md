  <h1>🚀 CS123A-Term-Project</h1>
Hello and welcome to our CS123A Term Project, where we tackle <a href="(https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-777)">OSD - 777</a>. This dataset dives into identifying the effects of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on mice. In our code, we build models using different algorithms to identify which one is best suited for predicting whether or not someone would experience cognitive decline as a result of GCR!

  <h2>🌟 Highlights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🧠 Applied different ML algorithms to predict cognitive decline based on microglial data.</li>
    <li>🔬 Split the dataset by biological sex — since GCR impacts male mice more than female mice.</li>
    <li>📈 Model Performance Summary:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Logistic Regression</strong> — Training: 100%, Testing: 86%</li>
        <li><strong>Random Forest</strong> — Training: 100%, Testing: 100%</li>
        <li><strong>Single Layer Perceptron</strong> — Training: 71%, Testing: 71%</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ℹ️ Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Astronauts traveling into deep space will be exposed to <strong>Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR)</strong>, which poses risks to their <strong>cognitive health</strong>.
    Understanding these biological impacts is critical to ensuring long-term astronaut safety during space missions.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this project, we analyze biological data from mice exposed to simulated space radiation. We use this data to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply <strong>Logistic Regression</strong>, <strong>Random Forests</strong>, and <strong>Single Layer Perceptron</strong> models.</li>
    <li>Evaluate and compare the predictive performance of each model.</li>
    <li>Analyze sex-specific biological responses, as female mice are less affected.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our work may support future studies on space radiation and human health.</p>
